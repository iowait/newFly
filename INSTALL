INSTALLATION OF FLY flight management software

Check the website -> https://www.SoaringTools.org/ for more documentation & support

#### OUR FAMOUS ONE HOUR TERRIBLY MANUAL INSTALLATION - just kidding! Help us make it better! #####

1) Install the code -- get in top directory, for this demo we expect /fly to
be the top URL for access

# DO NOT choose 'fly' as your destination, security by obscurity...
# If you have problems with using https from your internet provider
# you can go to the gitlab project (https://gitlab.com/jmurtari/fly)
# and download a zip/tar file, then transfer to your website..

[murtari@torch ~]$ git clone https://gitlab.com/jmurtari/fly.git fly

2) Setup the initial database.  You need to record the database name,
user name, and password. They all need to be different and at least 8 characters
long.  The password must include 1 uppercase, 1 numeric, 1 special.
Don't cheat, when the software starts it will check.

[murtari@torch fly]$ dir etc
addGnu.sed  fly.db.sql.gz mode.inc

# NOTE: on systems if you 'sudo su' and become root, no need to use -u and -p options
[murtari@torch fly]$ mysqladmin -u root -p'XXXXXX' create BigBippity

[murtari@torch fly]$ zcat etc/fly.db.sql.gz | mysql -u root  -p'XXXXXX' BigBippity

[murtari@torch fly]$ mysql -u root  -p'XXXXXX'
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

mysql> CREATE USER 'BigBongo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Never4^Guess';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON BigBippity.* to 'BigBongo'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

## NOT USED NOW, BUT IF YOU EVER WANT TO CHANGE THE DB PASSWORD LATER
mysql> ALTER USER BigBongo@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'Bigger4?Newer';

2a) Confirm the database setup by a login, show the tables, give
yourself admin access

[murtari@torch fly]$ mysql -u BigBongo -p'Never4^Guess' BigBippity
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 504499

mysql> show tables;

| Tables_in_BigBippity |

# By default there is one privileged admin user. Find their MemberID
# with:

mysql> SELECT lastName, MemberID FROM Members WHERE access LIKE '%ADMIN%';
+----------+----------+
| lastName | MemberID |
+----------+----------+
| Admin    |       24 |

# You must change the email address to your address
# MAKE SURE you get 1 row matched, 1 row changed

mysql> UPDATE Members SET emailAddr='you@youremail.org'  WHERE MemberID=24;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0



3) Configure the software

# Edit some config files in the fly folder
[murtari@torch fly]$ cd lib

# Copy the template file for configuration to the lib directory
[murtari@torch lib]$ cp ../etc/mode.inc .

[murtari@torch lib]$ vi mode.inc

# In the mode.inc insert the values for FAC_DB to match your DB name,
# also DB_PASS, DB_USER to match the DB user/password

# Change the ROOT_DIR to absolute path to the home directory for your
# web site.  Change FLY_DIR to be ONLY the name of the directory where
# you installed the FLY software, no slashes.  Should be a
# subdirectory of your ROOT_DIR

# Check the other values that use the word "fly" and set as
# appropriate

# At the end of the file you'll find entries for High-Far-Long
# competition If it's to be used, you must update with the name,
# location of your field.


3a) Setup debug/hfl/photos dirs needed

# create the debug.log, set the permission so webserver can only write, no read
[soaringtools@torch lib]$ cd ..
[soaringtools@torch fly]$ touch debug.log
[soaringtools@torch fly]$ chmod go=w debug.log
[soaringtools@torch fly]$ mkdir hfl
[soaringtools@torch fly]$ chmod go+w hfl
[soaringtools@torch fly]$ chmod -R go+w photos



# VERY IMPORTANT, check so read/write matches below
[soaringtools@torch fly]$ ls -ld debug.log hfl photos
-rw--w--w- 1 soaringtools www 0    Jun  5 15:56 debug.log
drwxrwxrwx 2 soaringtools www 4096 Oct  9 13:17 hfl
drwxrwxrwx 4 soaringtools www 4096 Oct  9 13:01 photos


4) Check the basic install location/URL.  This has nothing to do with
the database or other configuration items.  It just confirms you
installed it in the proper directory and the URL works.

# If your main website was called:  http://www.murtari.org/
# Then go to the URL:  http://www.murtari.org/fly

DON'T PANIC - you should see an "Under Construction" page, that's to
fool people who are just fishing for content.

If you get a 404 or File Not Found, the you did not install FLY as a
subdirectory/folder underneath the home directory for your website.

If you get a "Forbidden" or "Internal Server error" or other type of
permission error it may be your provider requires a uniq permission
set.  Do an 'ls -l' on files you know work and change the fly install
to the same values.   Also check the .htaccess in the fly directory,
some options may be incompatible with your server.

5) Passed step #4, now let's try a login!

# GO TO -> http://www.murtari.org/fly/login.php

You should see a screen with a title "FLY Management Software Demo".
BE CAREFUL: Make sure you don't see a message at the top 
"MySQL - can't connect to.. on localhost" If you do -> You need to
back to step 2/3 confirm the values are correct.

You don't the password for the admin account, we'll use the forgotten
password link at the bottom of the login page, click on that.

Just enter the same email address used earlier when configuring the
database above.

You should receive an email.  IF NOT - check with your web provider.
If you get an error message about no matching user, make sure you
complete the email change step above for the Admin-board user.

# Click on the reset link.  Set your new password, then return to the
# login screen and use your email address and password.  You should
# end up on the Control Panel.

If you follow the links across the top, you should see dummy event,
aircraft, and schedule info.


6) Install CRON jobs for backups and schedule reminders/alerts

What follows is a typical CRON installation, commentary above each line:

# Do an nightly backup of the web files and database
# Replace the word 'fly' with your installation specific info
30 23 * * * (~/fly/bin/doBackup.php fly) | mail -s "SoaringTools fly backups" joe@fly.org 2>&1

# For situations where weekend flying is primary (SAT/SUN)
# Send out duty/crew reminders on tuesday and wednesday
1  1  * * tue,wed  ( cd ~/fly; ~/fly/bin/manageSched.php ) | mail -s "SoaringTools Fly duty reminders" joe@fly.org 2>&1

# To each duty RI or instructor, send an alert email for members who haven't ACK'd
1  1 *  * thu ( cd ~/fly; ~/fly/bin/manageSched.php -A) | mail -s "SoaringTools Fly ALERT RI" joe@fly.org 2>&1

# Send a message out (using mailing list address) to all club members with the weekend schedule
9  9 *  * fri ( cd ~/fly; ~/fly/bin/manageSched.php -S) | mail -s "SoaringTools Fly Weekend Schedule" joe@fly.org 2>&1
